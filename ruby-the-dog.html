      <h3>A little bit about Ruby the dog</h3>
        <p>
          Ruby is is not just a dog. She is a very special dog. Ruby is my dog. I bought her from a very compasionate breeder who holds herself to a high ethical standard and treats all of her dogs very well. We got her when she was 8 weeks old and still _very_ wild. She is now 4 years old and incredible well behaved and mild mannered.
        </p>
